The source code is built by **NodeJs**. If you want to run it, just know some commands. 
- Run **npm install** or **yarn install** or **pnpm install** to install all library.
- Run **npm run dev** or **yarn dev** or **pnpm dev** to run app with development environment.
- Run **npm run build** or **yarn build** or **pnpm build** to build the app.
- Run **npm start** or **yarn start** or **pnpm start** to run app on production (you must "build" app before).
